## Use the training.py file to train your pdb files 

the script will asks you as input your files  driectory the asks for your protein file name 
this will generate your nuclotides pair scores in a folder  called training_sets

## Use the scoring_interpolation.py file to calculate the free gibbs energy 
the script will asks you as input your files  driectory then asks for your protein file name 
this will generate your nuclotides pair scores after applying inerpolation in your current directory 

## Use the plotting.R file to display different Gibbs energy profiles 

the script will asks you as input your files  driectory then plots all the available scores of nucleotides existing in the folder
